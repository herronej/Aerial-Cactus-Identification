# Aerial-Cactus-Identification
Final group project for ECE 571 Pattern Recognition Spring 2019

Uses datasets from Aerial Cactus Recognition Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification 

# Steps to follow
* Data normalization
* Dimensionality reduction
* Classification with the following
* MPP (case 1, 2, and 3)
* kNN with different k's
* BPNN 
* Decision tree 
* SVM 
* clustering (kmeans, wta, kohonen, or mean-shift)
* Classifier fusion
* Evaluation (use n-fold cross validation to generate confusion matrix and ROC curve if applicable).
